# Scripting For Adobe Apps

---
Various scripts and automation resources for Adobe applications, specifically Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat. The majority of the scripts in this repository are linked submodules from other authors, please be sure to respect their individual licensing and preferences for use/re-use. Scripts that I have personally authored are generally located in the root of the repository, or within a categorized subfolder, and will include my boilerplate at the top, and unless noted otherwise are freely available to be used, modified, or duplicated without limitation or prior approval.
